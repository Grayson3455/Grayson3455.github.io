My name is Guoxiang (Grayson) Tong, and I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Cardiovascular Biomechanics Computation Lab](https://cbcl.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University, supervised by [Dr. Alison L. Marsden](https://cbcl.stanford.edu/people/alison-marsden). My research focuses on simulation and uncertainty quantification of soft biological tissue growth and remodeling.

I graduated from [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/) in Spring 2025, majoring applied mathematics, computation, and statistics ([ACMS](https://acms.nd.edu/)). I worked with [Dr. Daniele E. Schiavazzi](https://www3.nd.edu/~dschiava/) and [Dr. Carlos A. Sing Long](https://ingenieriabiologicaymedica.uc.cl/en/people/faculty/186-carlos-a-sing-long), focusing on inverse problems, identifiability analysis, and uncertainty quantification of physics-based models.

Previously, I studied mechanical engineering at [University of Colorado at Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/engineering/academics/undergraduate-programs/mechanical-engineering). My master's thesis was on divergence-conforming Isogeometric analysis of incompressible turbulent flows, advised by [Dr. John A. Evans](https://www.colorado.edu/isogeometric/john-evans) and [Dr. David Kamensky](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-kamensky-b1901a192/).
