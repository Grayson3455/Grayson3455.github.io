My name is Guoxiang Grayson Tong, and I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Notre Dame, studying applied mathematics, computation, and statistics (ACMS). I work under the supervision of [Dr. Daniele E. Schiavazzi](https://www3.nd.edu/~dschiava/) and [Dr. Carlos A. Sing Long](https://ingenieriabiologicaymedica.uc.cl/en/people/faculty/186-carlos-a-sing-long), focusing on inverse problems, identifiability analysis, and uncertainty quantification of physics-based models. I am also interested in computational mechanics, likelihood-free inference, and medical imaging analysis.

**I am actively seeking Postdoctoral positions starting in summer/fall 2025.**
